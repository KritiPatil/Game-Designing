1. The name of my game is Seedling Dead or Seedling Live
2. The goal of the game is to make sure the seedling grows fully.
3. The story of my game is to take care of my plant and make sure it lives thorugh the weather changes and animal attacks.
4. The playing characters in the game are the person taking care of the plant and the plant it self.
5. The non-plaing character in the game are the animals that are going to attack the plant and the pest control team.
6. I plan on making my game engaging by letting the play choose where they want the garden, what type of plant they want to grow and what the name of the character is.
